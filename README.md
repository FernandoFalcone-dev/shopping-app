# Angular Shopping Application

Welcome to our Angular Shopping Application! This innovative platform is designed to streamline your shopping experience. It serves as a comprehensive tool for managing your shopping lists and organizing your recipes with ease. Our goal is to simplify your life by providing a one-stop solution for all your shopping and cooking needs.

## Features

The application offers a range of features to enhance your shopping and cooking experience:

- **Recipe Book**: View your collection of recipes at a glance.
- **Recipe Management**: Create, edit, and save your favorite recipes.
- **Shopping List**: Generate and manage your shopping lists based on your recipes.
- **Ingredient Addition**: Easily add ingredients from your recipes to your shopping list.
- **Shopping List Management**: Keep track of what you've bought and what's still on your list.

This project was bootstrapped with Angular CLI version 13.3.0.

## Setting Up the Development Server

To start the development server, run `ng serve`. This will host the application at `http://localhost:4200/`. Any changes made to the source files will trigger an automatic reload of the application.

## Generating Code Scaffolding

You can generate a new component by running `ng generate component component-name`. Other scaffolding commands include `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Building the Project

To build the project, use the command `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Executing Unit Tests

Unit tests can be executed by running `ng test`. These tests are performed via Karma.

## Executing End-to-End Tests

End-to-end tests can be executed by running `ng e2e`. To use this command, you first need to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
